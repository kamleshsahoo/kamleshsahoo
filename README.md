## Hey there! 👋 I'm Kamlesh 
I enjoy programming because it lets me channel my creativity into solving real-world problems.

I love building Rust-based backend systems, for memory safe and computationally lean architectures. Recently, I have been playing around with WASM frameworks like Dioxus, to build lightweight and snappy web interfaces. Checkout my Rust-powered orderbook implementation written in pure Rust, with a Dioxus frontend. 

### ✍️ I Also Write About
- **Rust internals** and how to master its **borrow checker without losing sanity**
- **Socket programming** for real-time applications like trading engines and chat systems
- Implementing **efficient** data structures like AVL trees with zero-copy abstractions
- **Concurrent** programming with Tokio's asynchronous runtime  

You can read about these concepts in my technical blog, where I cover them in depth.

### 🛠️ Engineering Philosophy
I believe great software should be invisible—solving problems so effectively that users forget technology is involved at all. As Arthur C. Clarke quotes- "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

### 🎮 When I’m Not Coding...  
You’ll probably find me **strategizing for a FromSoftware boss fight**, because problem-solving extends beyond programming.  

Happy coding! 🦀🚀
